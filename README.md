# agent-content-router

Signal-based purchase optimizer for AI agents navigating the paid content web.

## Overview

As AI agents become the primary consumers of the web, the content tech stack is shifting from human-centric ad models to agent-centric licensing and metering. This project implements a **Purchase Optimizer** that takes priced content candidates (via TollBit, Cloudflare 402, or Microsoft PCM) and outputs an optimal purchase plan.
The goal is to maximize expected answer quality and signal depth per dollar while staying within budget and time constraints.
